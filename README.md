# Covid 19 Dashboard Report!

**live preview: https://dashpord.vercel.app/**

- Exercise of what I learn with getStaticProps function on Next js.
- More exercice on Next js.
- More exercice on converting figma styles into code.

**The main foucus here is getStaticProps with next,
Maybe it need handle centerize state with Redux,
The code is only for Dashboard tab,
Maybe fetching data is not in best practice with Next js or with Javascript**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
